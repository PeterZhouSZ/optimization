=== Python Convex Optimization Package ===

We are working on building some generic implementations for convex optimization
and other optimization related routines in python. The goal is not to make a
disciplined convex optimization package, but to create tools for reguarly used
optimization utilities.

Required packages:
1. Numpy
2. Scipy
3. Cython

More information will follow.
